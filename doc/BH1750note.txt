/*
    BH1750 has six different measurement modes. They are divided in two groups;
    continuous and one-time measurements. In continuous mode, sensor continuously
    measures lightness value. In one-time mode the sensor makes only one
    measurement and then goes into Power Down mode.
    Each mode, has three different precisions:
      - Low Resolution Mode - (4 lx precision, 16ms measurement time)
      - High Resolution Mode - (1 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)
      - High Resolution Mode 2 - (0.5 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)
    By default, the library uses Continuous High Resolution Mode, but you can
    set any other mode, by passing it to BH1750.begin() or BH1750.configure()
    functions.
    [!] Remember, if you use One-Time mode, your sensor will go to Power Down
    mode each time, when it completes a measurement and you've read it.

      BH1750_CONTINUOUS_LOW_RES_MODE
